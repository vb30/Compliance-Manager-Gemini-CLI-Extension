# ✅ FIXED! MCP Server Issue Resolved

## The Problem

The MCP server was failing to start because:
1. Google Cloud libraries were writing warning messages to stderr
2. The MCP protocol uses stdio (stdin/stdout) for communication
3. Stderr noise was interfering with the MCP protocol
4. Gemini CLI saw this as a connection failure

## The Solution

Updated `gemini-extension.json` to:
1. Redirect stderr to `/dev/null` to suppress warnings
2. Set environment variables to reduce Google Cloud logging
3. Use bash wrapper to ensure clean stdio communication

## What Was Changed

**File**: `~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/gemini-extension.json`

**Changes**:
- Changed command from `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv` to `bash`
- Added bash wrapper to redirect stderr: `2>/dev/null`
- Added environment variables: `GRPC_VERBOSITY=ERROR` and `GLOG_minloglevel=2`

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Gemini CLI

**Exit the current Gemini CLI session** (press Ctrl+C or type `exit`)

Then start it again:
```bash
gemini
```

### 2. Verify the Extension Loads

You should see:
```
Loading extension: compliance-manager (version: 1.0.0)
```

And at the bottom:
```
Using 2 GEMINI.md files and 1 MCP server (ctrl+t to view)
```

**There should be NO errors this time!**

### 3. Test the Extension

Try this command in Gemini CLI:

```
List all compliance frameworks in organization 1035865795181
```

Gemini should:
1. Understand you want to list frameworks
2. Call the `list_frameworks` tool automatically
3. Show you the results

### 4. Verify MCP Server Status

Press `Ctrl+T` in Gemini CLI to see MCP servers. You should see:
- Server name: `compliance-manager-mcp`
- Status: **Connected** ✅ (not "failed to connect")

## How to Use the Extension

### ✅ CORRECT Usage (Natural Language)

```
List all compliance frameworks in organization 1035865795181
```

```
Show me cloud controls available in my organization
```

```
What framework deployments exist in project csc-audit-test-project?
```

### ❌ WRONG Usage (Don't use @ symbol)

```
@compliance-manager-mcp list_frameworks
```

The `@` symbol is for files, not MCP tools!

## Test Commands

Once Gemini CLI is restarted, try these:

### Command 1: List Frameworks
```
I need to see all compliance frameworks available in organization 1035865795181
```

### Command 2: List Cloud Controls
```
Show me all cloud controls in organization 1035865795181
```

### Command 3: Check Deployments
```
What framework deployments are in project csc-audit-test-project?
```

### Command 4: Get Help
```
I'm new to Compliance Manager. Can you explain what tools are available and show me what's in organization 1035865795181?
```

## Verification Checklist

After restarting Gemini CLI:

- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] "Using 2 GEMINI.md files and 1 MCP server" shown
- [ ] No "1 error" indicator
- [ ] Ctrl+T shows `compliance-manager-mcp` as **connected**
- [ ] Natural language commands work

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check the error** (Ctrl+O in Gemini CLI)
2. **Check MCP status** (Ctrl+T in Gemini CLI)
3. **Verify the config**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/gemini-extension.json
   ```
4. **Test manually**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | bash -c "GRPC_VERBOSITY=ERROR GLOG_minloglevel=2 /opt/homebrew/bin/uv run compliance_manager_mcp.py 2>/dev/null"
   ```
   Should return a JSON response without errors.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Updated gemini-extension.json to suppress stderr warnings
✅ **Tested**: MCP server now responds cleanly
✅ **Ready**: Restart Gemini CLI and test!

**Now restart Gemini CLI and try it!** 🚀
