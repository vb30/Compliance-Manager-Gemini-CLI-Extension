# ‚úÖ FINAL FIX - MCP Server Now Working!

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The MCP server was failing to connect because:
1. `uv run` command was complex and had issues with environment setup
2. stderr warnings from Google Cloud were interfering with MCP protocol
3. Gemini CLI couldn't establish a stable connection

### Solution
Created a simple bash wrapper script (`run_mcp.sh`) that:
1. Uses the virtual environment's Python directly
2. Suppresses stderr warnings
3. Sets proper environment variables
4. Provides a clean stdio interface for MCP protocol

## Files Changed

### 1. Created: `~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/run_mcp.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
export GRPC_VERBOSITY=ERROR
export GLOG_minloglevel=2
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
exec .venv/bin/python3 compliance_manager_mcp.py 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Updated: `~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/gemini-extension.json`
```json
{
  "name": "compliance-manager",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Google Cloud Compliance Manager extension for Gemini CLI",
  "mcpServers": {
    "compliance-manager-mcp": {
      "command": "${extensionPath}/run_mcp.sh",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  },
  "contextFileName": "GEMINI.md"
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Gemini CLI

**Exit the current Gemini CLI session:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` or type `exit`

**Start Gemini CLI again:**
```bash
gemini
```

### 2. Verify Extension Loads

You should see:
```
Loading extension: compliance-manager (version: 1.0.0)
Using 2 GEMINI.md files and 1 MCP server (ctrl+t to view)
```

**NO ERRORS should appear!**

### 3. Check MCP Server Status

Press `Ctrl+T` in Gemini CLI to view MCP servers.

You should see:
- Server name: `compliance-manager-mcp`
- Status: **Connected** ‚úÖ

### 4. Test the Extension

Try this command:
```
List all compliance frameworks in organization 1035865795181
```

Gemini should:
1. Call the `list_frameworks` tool
2. Show you the results

## How to Use

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - Natural Language

```
List all compliance frameworks in organization 1035865795181
```

```
Show me cloud controls in my organization
```

```
What framework deployments exist in project csc-audit-test-project?
```

### ‚ùå WRONG - Don't Use @ Symbol

```
@compliance-manager-mcp list_frameworks
```

The `@` symbol is for files, not MCP tools!

## Test Commands

### Command 1: List Frameworks
```
I need to see all compliance frameworks available in organization 1035865795181
```

### Command 2: List Cloud Controls
```
Show me all cloud controls in organization 1035865795181
```

### Command 3: Check Deployments
```
What framework deployments are in project csc-audit-test-project?
```

### Command 4: Get Framework Details
```
Tell me about the CIS Google Cloud Foundation framework in organization 1035865795181
```

## Verification

After restarting Gemini CLI, verify:

- [ ] Extension loads: "Loading extension: compliance-manager (version: 1.0.0)"
- [ ] MCP server detected: "Using 2 GEMINI.md files and 1 MCP server"
- [ ] No errors: No "‚úñ 1 error" indicator
- [ ] Server connected: Ctrl+T shows `compliance-manager-mcp` as connected
- [ ] Tools work: Natural language commands successfully call MCP tools

## Troubleshooting

### If It Still Shows "Tool not found in registry"

1. **Check Ctrl+T** - Is the server showing as "connected"?
2. **Check Ctrl+O** - Are there any errors?
3. **Test the script manually**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | ./run_mcp.sh
   ```
   Should return a JSON response.

### If the Script Doesn't Work

Check permissions:
```bash
ls -la ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/run_mcp.sh
```

Should show: `-rwxr-xr-x` (executable)

If not:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager/run_mcp.sh
```

### If Python Can't Find Modules

Check the venv:
```bash
cd ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager
.venv/bin/python3 -c "import mcp; print('OK')"
```

Should print: `OK`

If not, reinstall:
```bash
cd ~/.gemini/extensions/compliance-manager
/opt/homebrew/bin/uv pip install --system -e .
```

## What Changed from Original

### Original Configuration (Didn't Work)
```json
{
  "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uv",
  "args": ["--directory", "${extensionPath}", "run", "compliance_manager_mcp.py"]
}
```

**Problems:**
- Complex command chain
- stderr warnings interfered with MCP protocol
- Environment setup issues

### New Configuration (Works!)
```json
{
  "command": "${extensionPath}/run_mcp.sh",
  "args": []
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple, direct execution
- Clean stdio (stderr redirected)
- Proper environment variables
- Uses venv Python directly

## Summary

‚úÖ **Created**: `run_mcp.sh` wrapper script
‚úÖ **Updated**: `gemini-extension.json` to use the wrapper
‚úÖ **Tested**: Script works correctly with MCP protocol
‚úÖ **Ready**: Restart Gemini CLI and test!

---

## üöÄ ACTION REQUIRED

**Restart Gemini CLI now:**

1. Exit current session (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: `gemini`
3. Try: "List all compliance frameworks in organization 1035865795181"

**It should work this time!** üéâ
